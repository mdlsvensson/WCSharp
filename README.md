# WCSharp

**WCSharp** is a collection of libraries for C# development of custom maps and mods for Warcraft III. With these libraries you can **write map logic in C#** and transpile it into Lua code that the game engine can understand.

**Advantages of WCSharp over Lua (or Jass):**
* **Better Code:** C# is natively object-oriented, enabling cleaner, more maintainable code.
* **Type Safety:** Static typing prevents bugs during development, without the need for EmmyLua annotations.
* **IDE:** Write Warcraft III map logic in Visual Studio.
* **Built in Systems:** WCSharp has several [built in features for common systems](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* **C# development environment** (like **Visual Studio**):
	* When installing Visual Studio, make sure you select **Desktop & Mobile > .NET Desktop Development**.
	* If you've installed Visual Studio previously you can launch the **Visual Studio Installer** and **Modify** your installation instead.
	* WCSharp is built for .NET 6 and requires **Visual Studio 17.0 or higher**.

### Installation

1. Download the [WCSharp template](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/WCSharp-template).
2. Open `WCSharpTemplate.sln` with Visual Studio and right click the `Launcher` project and select `Set as Startup Project`.
3. Right click the `Launcher` project and click `Manage NuGet Packages`. Update all NuGet packages.
4. Set the path to your Warcraft III executable inÂ `Launcher/app.config`.
5. Set the `BASE_MAP_PATH` in `Launcher/Program.cs` to the path of your saved map-folder.
6. Move the included `Blizzard.j` and `common.j` files to `C:\Users\[Username]\My Documents\Warcraft III\JassHelper`.
7. Run the `Launcher` project in Visual Studio.

### Map Setup

1. Drag-and-drop the source.w3x folder onto an open World Editor window to open the template map.
2. Go to the Object Editor and copy the Dummy unit.
3. Create a new map (or open an existing map) and paste the Dummy unit into the Object Editor.
4. Go to **Scenario > Map Options** and set the Script Language to Lua.
5. Save your map as **Warcraft III Scenario Folder - Expansion**.

## WCSharp.API

**WCSharp** features a [dedicated API](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki/WCSharp.Api), serving as a replacement for War3Api. It provides an intuitive way of interacting with Warcraft III handles.

```cs
// War3Api
var unit = CreateUnit("hfoo", Player(0), 0, 0, 270); // Create a unit
SetUnitState(unit, UNIT_STATE_MANA, GetUnitState(unit, UNIT_STATE_MANA) + 50); // Increase its mana by 50
KillUnit(unit); // Kill the unit

// WCSharp.Api
var unit = unit.Create("hfoo", Player(0), 0, 0, 270); // constructor support will be added in the future, there's a bug with CSharpLua for the time being
unit.Mana += 50;
unit.Kill();
```

## Documentation

Each individual system is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/Orden4/WCSharp/wiki). The code includes Visual Studio XML documentation comments, allowing quick access by hovering code elements in your IDE.
